# HCL Test Users List

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.15.

## Problem Statement
- Use and extend the existing boilerplate code so that it fetches and displays the list of users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users API endpoint. Only consider `name`, `username`, `email`, `phone` and `website` fields.
   - Add functionality to filter the list of users based on column specified
      - Make use of Reactive Form to achieve the same.
   - Write unit tests
   - Use/Create Typescript types wherever deemed necessary
   - Follow proper coding conventions and best practices

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
